# prime-numbers
Python program that determines if a number is prime

A prime number is a number (not including 1) that is only evenly divisible by two numbers: itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6. This program prompts the user to enter a number. If the user enters -1, then the program ends. Otherwise, a message is displayed indicating whether or not the number is prime.
